Imagine you are designing a new blockcahin system

I would encourage honest behaviour and trustless aspect of design. Community driven governance. Each person can progress towards an equal weight of governmental vote. Priority agenda is free/low cost education on the platform. Users can protect their assets, know how to spot and report bad actors. I would encourage a honest behaviour.

Politically; Encourage Freedom of Ownership, Freedom of speech and Freedom of Privavcy

What behaviour/aspects of the system do you want to encourage?

I would discourage bad actors, people who lie, steal and decieve other network users. Ofcourse no double spending, exploit or hack to damage the intergrity of the system/network.

What means do I have for this incentivisation of the system?

I would incentivise people behaviour by funding those who complete educational tasks and provide them the maximum allowed weighted governance voting. I would discourage bad actors, people who lie, steal and decieve other network users. Loyalty scheme reward system.
